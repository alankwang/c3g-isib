Utilized R to visualize and model biomarkers that are good predictors of renal failure.

Kidney disease is a progressive disease in which the kidneys lose their ability to properly filter waste and excess fluids from the blood
The glomerulus-filtering unit of the kidney functions as a filter for our blood, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of kidney function.
Current treatment options include kidney transplants and dialysis. C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) is a form of kidney disease in which an abundance of the  protein C3 is present in the glomerular capillaries. About half of the patients with C3G have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years, so the purpose is to improve predictions of future renal failure using various biomarkers.
